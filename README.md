# Benefit-Cost-Analysis-Of-Dam-Construction

## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive benefit-cost analysis of two proposed dam construction projects. The analysis uses statistical simulations to estimate potential economic outcomes for each project, helping decision-makers choose the most beneficial option.

## Introduction
The project assesses the feasibility of dam construction projects based on various benefits like hydroelectric power, navigation, recreation, commercial development, and flood control. Using Excel, 10,000 simulations were conducted for each dam to determine the benefit-cost ratio, aiding in identifying the most economically viable project.

## Objectives
- To simulate potential economic outcomes for two dam construction projects.
- To perform a benefit-cost analysis using statistical methods.
- To visualize the simulation outcomes to compare the advantages of each project.

## Methods
- **Simulation Technique:** Used Excel's `RAND()` function to generate 10,000 random samples for benefit and cost components of each dam.
- **Triangular Distribution:** Employed for random number generation to model the distributions of benefits and costs.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Chi-squared goodness of fit test was used to validate the theoretical probability distribution against the observed data.

## Results
- **Visualizations:** Benefit-cost ratios for each dam were visualized to display the range of possible outcomes.

- **Statistical Comparison:** Analyzed and compared key statistics like minimum, maximum, mean, and median from the simulations to guide investment decisions.

## Key Findings
- **Dam 1** and **Dam 2** showed different patterns in the distribution of benefit-cost ratios, with one dam generally presenting a more favorable economic profile.
- The analysis provided crucial insights into which dam project could potentially offer greater economic benefits.

## How to Run the Simulation
1. Open the Excel file containing the simulation data.
2. Run the simulation script provided in the Excel sheet.
3. View the histograms and statistical summaries generated by the script for each dam.

## Conclusion
The simulations indicate which dam might offer better economic benefits based on the calculated benefit-cost ratios. These findings can assist in making informed decisions regarding the investments in dam construction projects.
